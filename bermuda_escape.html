Escape from the Bermuda triangle
Bermuda_anon
Summary:
A young officers plane gets downed on a supply run to Bermuda. Lost in the jungle he finds more than just adventure.

Chapter 1
Chapter Text
You board the plane. It's your first time aboard an aircraft and it's the first time you you have the opportunity to see a flying machine up close. That's not to say you have never seen an aircraft before, back in London you saw plenty overhead, courtesy of the German blitz. Those hateful small dots in the sky, raining death and destruction, they seemed so ascendent up there, so aloof, untouchable by you who where the subjects of their terror. They used to fill you with rage and feeling of impotence, those small angels of the sky, forever out of your reach.
"Get to your seat and buckle up, kid!"
You are jolted out of your reminiscence by what you assume is the captain of of the aircraft, an american a few years older than you. You feel both a bit irritated and humiliated being called a kid by some cocky new worlder, back in England your surname would at least grant you some courtesy from the low born. This however, is America. Here they give no heed to birth or creed. To make things worse, he has every right to call you boy. He's everything you aspired to be, handsome, tall and an attitude of complete confidence and nonchalance like a hero torn directly from the silver screen. A knight of the sky, clad in a leather flight jacket and aviators. You a, skinny, pampered boy from an upper crust home in the London countryside.
You had tried to become an aviator but your less than perfect eyesight killed that dream right at the recruitment office. Failing that you tried to join the royal artillery, to man the Flak batteries defending London in an attempt to get some modicum of vengeance at your flying tormentors and a sky you where denied. Your father, a minor lord with some clout in the military had other ideas. Abhorred by the idea that his son would be hauling heavy loads side by side with conscripted coalers and dock workers, he had you whisked away to an officers academy as soon as he heard what you where up to. They whipped you just as hard as a cadet as they would do any raw recruit but at least it was a man of proper station doing the whipping and that was all your father cared about.
You look out the window from your seat. Making a coughing sound, the propeller start turning. Soon the aircraft vibrates as the engines roar with power. With a jerk the plane starts to move down the runway, slow at first but picking up terrific speed faster than you thought possible. You cling to your seat as you feel the acceleration pull on you. You close your eyes and pray a quick prayer that the pilot know what he's doing.
Apparently he did because the first thing you notice as you open your eyes is that you are far off the ground. For a moment you feel invincible, looking down at the world, everything ant sized. You make a mental note that you shall become a pilot in some capacity or die trying. The feeling fades rather quick however as the flight draws on. It's exceedingly noisy and except the captain and the copilot, you are the only passenger. There is little to do and only miles of sea below you by now. If flight is this monotone and noisy, maybe it's not so great after all you think. Nothing like a proper ship with a bar and a captains mess.
You decide to go over your mission papers again to pass the time.
You open your briefcase and take out the folder reading "Royal Corps of Signals" on front. Your first assignment.
Inside is various papers pertaining your mission.
-Boat ticket, UK-USA
-Papers to give to liaison officers at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
-Technical papers on a new, secret listening device to be installed at overseas territory Bermuda, listening for Enigma signals from German U-boats
-Instructions where to meet up with captain Jackson who will fly you and your listening device hidden among some token supplies to Bermuda.
-Orders to contact local Commonwealth forces, to oversee the installment and operation of said listening device until further orders are given.
Royal Corps of Signals. Again your fathers work. He wasn't content with having you being an officer, he made sure you where as far from any war front as humanly possible. Oh well, there are worse fates in war than being stationed at a tropical island doing nothing.
Somehow you feel that you got off lucky. You put away the papers and decide to doze off as best you can for the remainder of you journey.

You wake up sharply as your head strikes the seat in front of you. Thank god that the Americans can afford such luxuries as cushioned seats.
The plane jerks violently. This is your first time in air and still you can deduct that this kind of movement is not the kind any aircraft in the business of being airborne should be doing. Another violent throw racks the plane and you are thrown hard against the belt holding you in your seat. A sharp bang from outside the aircraft is accompanied by a flash of light. As you look outside you see the engine billow black smoke and oil, propeller not turning. Panic starts to bubble up inside you. This is definitely not good. The plane takes a sharp nose dive and you realize that you are about to die. The door to the cockpit has been flung open and through it, beyond the wind screen you see the dark blue sea on rapid approach. Somehow, the certain prospect of your death fills you with some grim calm, reflecting over how cruel the sky can be, first to be denied you and the killed by it as soon as you get even a taste of it.
You close your eyes and await your fate.
A blinding flash sears trough your closed eyelids. You open your eyes and note that afterlife is terribly noisy. Most of the noise comes from a huge tear in the fuselage in front of you. Through the windows you see that a massive forest expands below you. You reflect little over how this forest appeared in the middle of the sea because you know a forest will kill you just as sure as the sea will if you crash your plane into it. You feel that despite having lived through what could be called a miracle, your situation has not improved. If the situation does not improve, does it still classify as a miracle you wonder?
The miracle as it turns out, is the captains skill behind the stick. Somehow to your amazement he manages to regain control over the stricken aircraft, pulling the plane away from its doomed descent.
"Feather number 1 engine, I'll put us down in that lake ahead" you hear the captain shout to his co-pilot.
You feel a small glimmer of hope as you see a small lake ahead through the cockpit door. Is it possible to land a plane on such a small lake? Can planes land on lakes to begin with? As the captain angles in for final approach, the captain turns around in and shouts at you.
"Hang on kid, it's going to be rough!"
You cover your head with your arms and double over in your seat. A slight annoyance over being called a kid again is the last thing passing through your mind before your world becomes one of noise, spinning and pain.

You open your eyes. Everything hurts. Your arms, your back, your legs, everything. You groan a bit. Your general status does not improve.
You try to move your head. Your neck hurts but it still works. You look around and try to appraise the situation. You are entangled in seating and what once was a fuselage. Everything that once made up a fine aircraft is now torn and twisted. Your head clears a bit and you start to feel brave enough to move a bit. Your entire body protests, your moves feel sluggish but you move. Nothing seems seriously broken and from what you can see, your limbs point in the right general direction. You start to untangle yourself and crawl through the twisted fuselage towards the light of the sky, shining in through the rear of the aircraft. As you crawl closer you see the sun shining through the gaping hole where the tail section has been torn away. You crawl to the edge and see that the surface of the lake is just a few inches below you. Not wanting to crawl back into the crumpled plane to look for an alternate exit, you spill yourself into the water.
The water enter your nose and your mouth and you breach the surface coughing and wheezing. As luck would have it the water is only about two feet deep, had it been any deeper you felt that there would be a serious risk of drowning as you are still in full uniform and in no condition to swim.
You slog your way around the aircraft and get a view of the whole scene. What was once a graceful master of the sky now looks like a mosquito smacked by a giant hand. The one wing is torn off, the other bent, the tail is missing and the nose has plowed a deep furrow in the sand bank at the shore, coming to a rest against a large tree further up the bank. It was not a gentle stop. The cockpit windows are smashed, the entire front of the plane is crumpled and deformed. The area around the small lake is surrounded by dense forests, temperate from the looks of it. The trees are well over one hundred feet tall and many more than trice as broad as you are over the shoulders. Thick undergrowth, what looks like bamboo and some kind of short palm trees are at the ground level, blocking you from seeing very far. You slog your way to the sand bank and collapse from exhaustion. Every fiber of your being hurts. Your uniform is all but torn to shreds, you are bleeding from several cuts and you feel like you have been trampled by a horse. Then you remember the captain. Your pain almost forgotten, you limp your way over to the smashed cockpit. Peering through the broken window, you see the captain and co-pilot. The co-pilot is decidedly dead, impaled on a sharp piece of metal. It's a ghastly sight and you look away your guts turning.
You force yourself to look at the captain. He's battered and bleeding, pinned to his seat by the instrument panel but alive. Seeing no way to free him, you remove your boot and walk down to the lake. You fill your boot with water, tear a piece from your uniform shirt and make your way back to the captain.
You reach inside the cockpit and start to clean the blood from his forehead, splash some water at his face and try to make him drink some directly from the boot. Under any normal circumstances, you would be disgusted by the very idea of someone drinking from a boot but at this moment you don't care and don't think the captain would either. Slowly the captain open his eyes. Calmly he looks at you, scans over to his unfortunate co-pilot and finally looks down at himself, mangled under the instrument panel. He looks back at you and you see a glimmer of the nonchalance and confidence he had when you boarded the plane.
"All up to you kid." he wheezes.
You look and feel dumbfounded.
"I'm no kid." is all you manage to respond.
The captain manages to chuckle with a coughing sound. Painstakingly he reaches into his jacket and gives you his wallet.
"Bring this to miss Anderson in Wyoming, will ya?"
You manage a nod.
He gives you a bloody smile and closes his eyes.
Despite your best efforts with bringing water and prying away the instrument panel, he dies later in the evening.
Seeing your only companion in this wilderness die fills you with such despair that you you just slumps against the side of the wreck and cries yourself to sleep in pure exhaustion.
You wake the following morning to the sound of crows. As soon as you realize what's going on, you jump up with a start and start shooing away the foul birds.
The brave captain saved your life and you'd rather have a vulture eat your liver than seeing the man consumed by carrion fowl.
Having slept a while has lessened the ache in both body and mind and you remember a shred of the stiff upper lip mentality whipped into you at the academy. With the captain dead, you are the highest ranking officer on the scene and it is your duty to return to High Command with a report of casualties. With grim determination you retrieve dog tags from the pilots, the blood not fazing you any more. You open the wallet and stuff the dog tags inside. You see a photo of woman inside and a folded telegram, yet to be delivered.
The girl on photo and the name on the telegram is the captains fiancee you hedge.
Given the situation of you and your cargo, the listening post won't be happening in the foreseeable future. Reporting back and delivering the captains telegram is you new task at hand and are determined to do so whatever it takes, come hell or high water. You settle down and take stock of the situation.
You realize that your wounds need to be taken care of, you need food and clean water. Remembering the supplies that the aircraft brought along with the listening device, you spring into as much action your body allows and start the arduous task of salvaging as much supplies you can from the wreck.
After several grueling hours, you have extracted as much as possible from the wreck. Much of your loot is broken, but you do find enough useful things to give you hope that you'll be able to march to a river or the sea.
You have a pup tent, some mosquito netting, your uniform greatcoat, a fresh BDU Jacket a mess kit, a canteen, lighter and fire steel, a couple of american D-rations, a fishing hook and some like, a bayonet, a spool of hemp wire, what remains you could gather from a medics bag and a canvas backpack.
You also found a can of ammunition and a smashed crate of SMLE rifles. Most where bent or cracked but you managed to pick together one rifle that could probably pass the armorers inspection. You pack your new belongings in the backpack, don the jacket and grab a bandolier and your rifle and make ready to set out to to find civilization. Your last act before leaving the wreck is to scoop up as much oil and gasoline you can from an engine and spread in and around the wreck. When you put your lighter to the wreck, it soon flares up in a blaze.
You shield your face from the heat and look at your handiwork. This is the funeral pyre for the pilots and your duty to destroy the classified documents and equipment you carried. You utter a silent prayer you remember from Sunday church, hoping it will guide the souls of the pilots on their way to heaven.
Watching the fire for a while, you follow the waterline, hoping to find a small creek to follow.
"When in a survival situation, find water and walk down stream" they taught during survival training.
"Civilization always bloom along the waterway" they said.
It was easier said than done it turns out.
At the far end of the lake you find that just a hundred yards up a small rivulet you find that the source of the lake is a tall waterfall running of a cliff at least fifty feet high. Any civilization or settlement following this waterway will have to wait until you find some way up that cliff.
Navigating by the sun, you decide to follow the cliff westward. At first you feel almost upbeat. You are just like Dr. Livingstone exploring far away lands or you might be the next Robinson Crusoe.
You feel that no jungle in the world can match the mettle of a British officer. You have the training and the spirit.
Unfortunately, as time goes on and your feet feel sore, questions and doubt start to creep up on you. How did you crash in a jungle this size between Florida and Bermuda? You saw Bahamas pass underneath you on your way out. What was those flashes outside the aircraft? What brought you out of the sky to begin with? What kind of forest is this? Are there lions in this kind of forest? Do I even have the slightest idea on what I'm doing? Fear starts to creep up your spine. What happens when it get dark? Are there cannibals around? Every noise start to sound like a tiger creeping up on you. What little sunlight that gets through the canopy leave dark areas in the undergrowth where you imagine hungry eyes looking at you. You stick to the rock face like a moss, edging along trying to keep your back free and scan every direction. To your horror you notice that the sun is setting rapidly. Everything is getting dark quickly.
Your only source of light is your lighter which when lit only serves to make the forest even darker outside the small circle of light it provides. You huddle up against the rock face, cover yourself with the great coat, hug your rifle, fix the bayonet and gnaw on a D-bar. In the darkness it's very cold but the familiar taste of bitter chocolate and the reassurance a rifle gives make things a little easier to bear. Still, You don't sleep may hours that night.

The following morning your breakfast consists of what remains of the D-ration and a few swigs from the canteen. You are still hungry but food is short. You pack up your meager belongings and start to march towards the unknown again. Your head is filled with thoughts of baked beans, bacon, toast with egg and tea. God, you could kill for a cup of tea right about now. You wander along following the seemingly endless cliff face.
That's when you meet her.
As you walk around a a bend in the cliff face you enter a small clearing and find yourself standing merely ten yards away from a woman, face to face.
The fact that it is a woman is evidently clear by the wide swaying hips, a loincloth failing barely hiding long well shaped thighs, leather wrappings struggling to keep a pair of large breasts at bay and wild long silvery hair reaching down to her midriff. Her skin is dark bronze, but her eyes are deep emerald almost shimmering despite the darkness of the forest. The beauty of her face makes you stop in your tracks and do a double take. Then you notice that her most striking feature is not her silver hair, her dark skin or proportions that not even a ancient Greek sculptor could do justice. It's her size. What you thought was a small piglet slung over her shoulder like a messenger bag is a big boar, tusks and all. A quick estimate gives you that she stands well over seven feet tall, closer to eight. Adding to that, she's not lanky but almost to the broad side with her hips and muscular shoulders. Oh, the muscles. In addition to her size she has perfectly chiseled abs, muscle tone that would make Michelangelo's David statue hit the gym. Biceps that rival the strong man at a circus but still in some peculiar way, feminine.
The shock of seeing her halts you almost in mid step. You simply cannot advert your gaze from this titan of a woman despite that her scant clothing should embarrass one of your upbringing. You stand there, your eyes locked to hers. A slight wind stirs her long hair as she stands there, her full lips slightly apart, eyes wide. You blink. You realize, she must be every bit as surprised as you. A spear that she was carrying falls from her hand like she simply forgot to hold onto it. You too would probably have dropped your weapon if it weren't for the sling. Score one for the civilized world.
She blinks.
Then you both start to move simultaneously. She lifts the boar off her shoulder and throws it aside like it was made of cotton. She looks around after her spear for a second not finding it immediately abandons it and approaches you in large strides, her eyes filled with determination.
You, having thrown your backpack clear, unsling you rifle and level it at her bayonet fixed. Your discipline as an officer of the Commonwealth takes over, days bayonet drilling guides your movements. You stand 5"10' holding the line. You feel confident.
"Halt in the name of the King" you bark.
She does not halt.
Before you can figure what to do next, she's upon you towering above you just as majestic and resolute as the massive trees that surround you.
Lightning fast, her hand darts out and grabs the barrel of your rifle, forcing it to the side. You training takes over. You swipe left trying to land a blow with the butt of the rifle. As it turns out, your training and almost six feet in height don't cut it against her strength and almost 8 foot. She expertly grabs the stock of the rifle in her other hand.
There you stand for a fraction of a moment, holding the rifle between you. You try to yank the rifle free. Any training you had is rendered useless as no one taught you how to free a rifle stuck in a large vise, for all your trying you could just as well have tried to yank the Excalibur from its stone.
Then she begin to lift the rifle above your head and starts to push but you refuse to let go. You feel like a curtain on the curtain rod, your feet barely scraping the ground as she lifts the rifle higher. You feel your back slam against the rock face you where following, almost winding you. Your face is pressed up against her leather bound breasts but with adrenalin pumping through your veins you hardly even notice. Having you pinned between her breasts and the rocks, she tries to pull the rifle free. Your grip is iron, resulting in a shameful but oh so pleasurable feeling as you slide up over her breasts, ending up face to face with her, barely an inch apart.
Again you lock eyes. Her face is so close that all you see is her green eyes boring into you and despite the adrenaline you feel like a blush is creeping up your face. Barely a second pass but under the adrenalin it feels like a minute and it gives you time to act. You nestle a finger into the trigger guard. You pull the trigger.
Little can prepare anyone who has not dealt with guns on how loud they are. You where prepared. She was not. With your ears ringing you fall to the ground, still holding the rifle. You adversary takes a few stumbling steps backwards holding her ears, eyes shut tight in pain. In her stunned state, she stumbles over a root and falls over backwards landing on her behind in a sitting position. You seize the opportunity and leap to your feet. You have to strike when she's on the ground, at your level. In one leap you spring at her and strikes a massive blow to the side of her head with the stock. Without uttering a sound she keels over on her side. She hits the ground with a thud. A brief moment passes and as your hearing returns, all you hear is distant birds singing and wind rustling leaves.
You allow yourself to sit down, your whole body shaking like a leaf with adrenalin. You crawl over to your backpack and take a few gulps from the canteen. You finally start to calm down. Then the fear sets in and you start to shake again.
Did you kill her? You struck a girl down! If that was a woman, what will the men look like? What will they do to you when they find that you struck one of their women? Have you started a new war? You start to panic as thoughts race your mind. You have to make things right. You sling your rifle over your shoulder and scramble over to your fallen foe. As you carefully approach her, you see that she's bleeding from a cut where you struck her, staining her silvery white hair red.
Prodding her with your boot yields no reaction whatsoever. Her breath fogs the bayonet when you hold it under her nose revealing that she's alive, for now at least. You attempt to prop her up against a tree but you soon find that she is too heavy for you to even budge from her position. Abandoning your attempts to move her you fetch your backpack, upend it beside her and tend to her wound with what medical supplies you have. It's not a large cut but it was a heavy blow. You disinfect, clean, bandage and cover her with your greatcoat, all in accordance to the Geneva convention. As expected of a British officer. After some quick thinking you opt for erecting your pup tent directly above her, negating any need to move her form her exposed position. It's not Buckingham palace but it'll keep any rain or wind at bay.
Feeling content with your work you start to relax a little. Sitting by the opening of the tent you hear your prisoners soft breath. You look over wondering what could have created such a large woman. The pup tent, made to house even a large corn fed American, leaves her head outside due to her size. Your greatcoat barely covers her torso, leaving her thighs exposed. Her thighs.
Just seeing those thighs, round but a faint muscle tone hinting at raw power causes a heat to build inside you. You reach over to lift the coat to see if yo-NO! You are a gentleman of high breed! You will do no such thing! This woman is in you care and she will be afforded utmost decency and respect.
To distract yourself from your impure mind you set out to make a camp around the shelter. You gather firewood, locate the nearest source of water, doing your best to skin and dress the discarded boar, cook a soup from the meat and some rations and care for the stricken lady as proper and correct as expected of a gentleman. Towards the evening she still hasn't woken up. You take her head in your lap and gently try to feed her some soup. Even if most of it end up on the ground you think she got to keep some.
By sunset you make a fire, cook some meat and eat dinner in silence. With your makeshift tent, a fireplace and some strips of meat hanging to dry covered in a mosquito netting, you start to feel a modicum of pride over your camp and your achievements. You have survived a plane crash and the following night, you have fought valiantly and taken a prisoner and you have rescued a maiden. Yes, the rescued maiden is giant, dwarfing even the largest of men, the wound she is suffering from was inflicted by you and she's a savage, but still. She is a maiden and more than fair.
As night draws close you crawl in beside your charge, outside the greatcoat mind you, and quickly fall asleep from the days exertion.
The following day follows the same pattern as the first, minus the brawl with an amazon. You eat some charred meat and D-ration for breakfast, gather firewood, try to coax some food into the still unconscious maiden. You head to a waterfall forming a large plunge pool you passed on your journey and actually manages to catch a fish. While sitting with your makeshift fishing rod your thoughts start to run. You cannot help but touch yourself remembering your face buried in those voluptuous breasts, those lips so close to yours, that butt, large and round but packed with power, those... In the end your left with a handful of goo and shame. You quickly wash away your sin hoping that if you release it here it won't fill you with indecent thoughts there. You return to your camp with the days catch.
You return to see everything as you left it, which means your patient has yet to wake up. You start to worry, how long can someone stay unconscious? Did you inflict serious injuries upon her? You decide to not worry yet and focus on preparing fish and the meal for the night. You idly wonder what will happen if she wakes up? Will she be cross with you? You decide to hide the rifle, just in case she gets any stupid ideas. You have yet to see even tracks of any larger animals, so you figure there is no immediate need for it right now in any case.
The following day follows the same pattern with cooking, firewood, fishing and venting impure thoughts far away where they will do no harm.
Upon returning things have changed. Your patient is up and standing in all her glory. She's standing in the middle of your little camp, idly probing the wound at her temple. She has been awake long enough to recover her spear you note.
You approach carefully. When she see you, she first gives you a blank stare, then her eyes go dark. She does indeed seem cross with you.

The amazon glares at you as you cautiously make your way into the camp. It's an decidedly unfriendly look she gives you. You get the feeling that the rifle would be nice to have about now. At the same time, you know that if you had the gun, any violence would most certainly end with at least one of you dying. On the other hand you also know that any violent confrontation as it stands now would lead to a violent death on your part alone. You slowly walk forward, holding the fish you caught as dagger or maybe a peace offering. You are not sure which.
Armed with your fish, you stop ten yards in front of her. Your father, a veteran from the Boer wars and stationed in Africa during his youth always lectured you on Boers and other types of savages.
"The common born and the savage will by instinct follow the order of their betters" your father always said.
You look up into her eyes trying to return her fierce stare.
"Surrender your spear, savage woman" you order.
You see muscles under her skin shift as she tense up.
"I order yo-" is as far you get with your second order before her spear lashes out towards you. You barely manage to yank your head aside, the flint tip scoring a line of fire across your left cheek. You don't even have the time to scream before she follows through the stab and you glimpse the back of her hand from the right. The next thing you know, you are flying. Your head is spinning, you have lost all sense of direction, of what is sky and what is ground. For a brief moment you feel like you are floating.
Then the ground meets you, driving all wind from your lungs. The world stops spinning and pain explodes across your face and body. Your left cheek is on fire, your right cheek feels numb, your lungs burn. You lay on your back gasping for breath when a huge foot crashes down on your chest, driving what air you had left from you. A spear is pointed at your throat. Your eyes follow the leg upwards, past a muscular thigh, up her loincloth. Somewhere nestled with the cascade of other pains and discomfort you think you feel a sting of shame for looking at a ladies underwear. As you expect to die violently within a moment, you indulge yourself that glance. You hope Saint Peter, a fellow man, will understand when you meet him at the pearly gates.
Your immediate demise is not as immediate as you first thought however. The spear hangs above you like the sword of Damocles but it refuses to fall. You look up at the face far above you. Green eyes glimmer back. Is it contempt or pity you see in her eyes? Curiosity? Whatever it is, it has stayed her hand. She looks away from your bruised face and glances over you small camp, the fire place, the mess kit, the drying meat, the pup tent. She looks back at you. She closes her eyes, gives a sigh and removes her foot from your chest. You start to breathe again.
She tosses her spear beside the shelter and casually bends down and pick you up by your jacket effortlessly like you where a small puppy. She drags you over to the fireplace where she settles down on her knees and place your head in her lap. Despite the hard muscle underneath, her bronze skin is soft and smooth under your cheek. You try to appear as lifeless as possible, afraid that any resistance will invoke her wrath again. You see her reach for a pot from the mess kit filled with water which she slowly pours on the wound on your face. Your face and jacket become soaked with water and blood. You remain motionless. You catch a glimpse of a small pouch she procures from the rope holding her loincloth in place. She dips her finger in what looks like some kind of black resin. She fixes your head in a vise like grip with one hand and smears the resin along your wound.
It burns like if Lucifer himself was taking a piss in your cheek, like a thousand fire ants tearing at your flesh. You try to remain still and quiet and you fail. You trash and scream, desperately trying to claw at the hellfire in your cheek. Her one hand remains in control over your head while her other hand catches your wrists and pin them to your body. Your are like a small child to her strength so you resort to screaming. You curse at and kick at this witch doctor working her black arts at you as high as your bruised ribs allow you. She remains calm, holding you still. Soon the pain subsides and you go limp. The amazon releases your arms and scrapes away the resin with a small flint blade. You cautiously probe the wound and to your amazement the blood has clotted completely and the wound itself seems to be held together by the residue of the resin. You drag yourself off her lap and sit up.
You wipe away some tears and look at the massive woman in front of you. She, apparently feeling done with you for the moment ignores you. She appears greatly fascinated by the metal pots and utensils of your mess kit and also managed to help her self to the strips of dry meat you hung up a few days ago. She apparently thinks of you as no threat as she makes no move to stop you as you shuffle your way over to a small pile of leaves. The pile with your rifle hidden in.
You calmly retrieve you rifle and walk over to the fire place opposite of her. She looks up from her studies of the pots and for a moment her face is one of question but then recognition dawns upon her like she remembered the brawl and the thunder your rifle could invoke. Her eyes darken but she makes no move to get up.
You stand still and take your time deciding what to do now that the balance of power has shifted in your direction.
Dr. Livingstone had relied on soft words to garner help from savages during their travels while others like H.M Stanley had relied on the whip to keep his subordinates in line.
To keep the savage in front of you in line by the whip would probably be like whipping a tiger into submission.
The look she gives you is definitely tiger like. Feeling that she would probably kill you in your sleep should you try to force her into submission, you decide that you are about even with her as far as scars go.
The Livingstone route it is.
You carefully sit down opposite of her across the fireplace, deliberately placing the rifle by your side a bit away from you. You hope this gesture will show her that you mean no harm but that you also won't suffer any more abuse from her. She relaxes slightly and resumes eating dried the meat but she keeps her gaze fixed on you, eyes suspicious. You try to tense down a bit to but your wet jacket and bruised ribs make it hard. You unbutton the jacket and lay it out to dry examining your now bare chest for scrapes and bruises. Despite the battering you have taken over the last few days, you seem to have held up well.
Feeling that something is off you look up at the amazon. She has frozen all movements, eyes wide staring at your naked chest. Before you can make any move she leaps like a giant cat over the fireplace onto you. How someone that big can move so fast and agile is beyond you. Again you find yourself pinned to the ground, this time her hand around your neck. Her other hand is busy running over your chest, feeling your ribs, your pecs, your shoulders again and again. Her hands are surprisingly soft even with their size, large as that of any man. Despite your best efforts you never managed to get any muscle tone while at the academy, your body is more of a boy than a man. Despite that, she seems to be almost fixed in trance looking at it. You try to struggle and try to pry her fingers open but you soon feel that it's no use under her immense strength and weight.
You cease struggling as the hand on throat is gentle but firm, not blocking your breathing but keeping you on your back for this impromptu medical exam.
She prods and knead your pecs like a doctor inspecting for tumors and while you find the treatment very undignified you feel that you can afford to indulge her curiosity a bit. You are probably the firs white man she's seen and who knows what traditions and rituals these savages have? You'll instruct her how to behave civilized in due time.
She bends over and sniffs your chest like one would sniff a steak for freshness.
Her eyes go wider and she looks at your face.
Suddenly her free hand darts in under your pants, under your underwear cupping your genitals. You go red with shock and embarrassment flailing wildly to get her off you. Her fingers are exploring every inch of your most private place, darting back and forth. Your hand finds your rifle and you pull it up between her and you. The sight of the gun breaks her fixation molesting you and she scrambles back a few yards. Half naked, hugging your rifle, face red with shame and embarrassment you tighten your belt as many holes you possibly can.
You feel the eyes of the amazon on you. You look up and meet her gaze. Despite you having the rifle, you see no hate or suspicion in it. What you read in her face is hunger, lust and greed. You feel like a hare under the gaze of a fox. She's opening and closing the molesting hand like she's remembering the feeling of it exploring your scrotum.
"This rabbit's got a gun, you savage" you mumble at her, face still red.
"ɣʏʂɴɳɰð ͜ŋɢɱ t͡ʃøəɲ?"she responds. Your head jerks up. It's the first time you hear her speak. It's a surprisingly mild voice in contrast to her large stature. What she said you have no idea but you think it was a question.
"What?" you blurt out.
"ʒɤ͡ɭʜ͜ʊ̈ʀʛ" she replies, pointing to the sky.
You look up to see the sky starting to turn pink. Sunset. Does ʒɤ͡ɭʜ͜ʊ̈ʀʛ imply that the sun is setting? You're fluent in German, french and Latin and can read five more languages. Language has always been one of your strong suites but this one has you stumped. You have no idea even what branch this language belongs to. You decide that linguistic studies will have to wait because if "ʒɤ͡ɭʜ͜ʊ̈ʀʛ" means sunset, the amazon is right. Sun is setting quickly and darkness will soon be upon you. You slowly start to pick through the camp, always keeping an eye on the amazon, rifle always close. The speed of which she jumped you makes you wary. You gather your mess kit, your few remaining rations and whatever else that seems to have been kicked over in your earlier struggle. you hang your jacket over a branch to dry as it's still soaked. The amazon regards you as someone who has her eyes on a large nugget of gold at the bottom of a stream. As you gather your possessions, she slowly approaches you, hands raised, palms toward you, like she's approaching an easily frightened animal. Maybe she also felt that you two is building up a rabbit-fox relationship? You watch her warily as she approach you, your body bruised from your previous contacts with her.
She points to your rifle and then to her spear on the ground, then crossing her arms in front of her chest. No weapons? Peace? Has she forgotten that she jumped you as soon as you let your guard down? Again she points to the spear and the gun and crosses her arms. You look at her face in the dying sunlight and you suddenly feel that she actually no longer have any ill intentions towards you.
You are not sure what her intentions towards you are at the moment but she didn't kill you before and you don't think she intend to do so now. You slowly put the rifle next to the spear.
The amazon smiles at you. It's a beautiful smile. Yet, you see a hunger in her face and you suddenly feel the impure thoughts stir within you. You have to remind yourself that you are a gentleman and you shall not desire any kind of lewd acts with any woman until you married proper under god! You are struck by the weirdness of the whole situation, the strange forest, this titan woman leading your thoughts to sin. Making sure you don't make any too quick moves you retreat into the tent and drag the great coat over you and curl into a ball. The entirety of your situation is too much for you to bear. While you know you can't hide from it, pretending to do so helps somewhat. You wonder what the amazon will do. Will she stay here or go on her way? Will she prepare another sleeping spot for herself? Is she waiting for you to be a gentleman and offer up the only tent? Surely no woman, no matter how savage would enter a tent with an unmarried man? What you did before was different since she was wounded and needed care. Besides you are a man, it's different what you do. Does she- Your frantic thoughts are interrupted as the amazon puts an end to your wonders. You hear her move and look up from under the great coat. You only see her outline in the tent opening opening as she crawls on her hands and knees into the small space with you. Despite being visible as a shadow against the last light outside, there is no doubt whatsoever. She intends to sleep with you. Naked. You go rigid as you feel her creep in under the great coat beside you.
You silently swear to yourself that you'll never again let go of the gun as long as this lewd amazon is around.
The small tent offer no escape as you feel her warm skin press against you naked back as she forms the big spoon to your small. You feel her large breasts press into you, warm and soft. You try to inch yourself away, to create an air gap between your bodies but her strong arms wrap you in a bear hug and draws you back into her breasts. Her body heat is immense and for the first time since you crashed in the jungle you are not cold at night.
To your horror, your little officer stands to attention at the feeling, despite and because how scandalous the situation is. Knowing that any kind of escape is impossible you place your hands between your legs to hide your erection and also safeguard against any further attacks and consign yourself to being forcibly snuggled.
The amazon shifts position slightly and the feeling of her breasts shifting against your back sends sparks of electricity shooting trough your body. Her one hand strokes your chest while her other hand cradles your head in under her face and she nuzzles your hair like you're a big teddy bear. A finger traces over your chest, down around your bellybutton, back tracing your ribs, up circling a nipple. Wherever she touches your skin tingles and burn.
Her hot breath stirs your hair making your cheeks burn hot like a stove.
Her hand traces downward again, across your belly and explores the shapes of your hips and follows the line of your belt. As you feel it snake itself towards your pubic area you turn your muscles to steel in apprehension, fearing that she again might gain entry to your pants.
Maybe she feels your apprehension, maybe it's the tight belt blocking her but she returns to stroking your chest and you relax a little.
The amazon whispers something in a soft voice to you, what exactly you have no idea but you are fairly certain that they would call it "sweet nothings" or some such in a romance novel. Her hand goes for another attempt at your pants but you knot up in a ball with all your might and you freeze all your movement.
Her hand retreats again and it seems like she surrenders the idea of getting into your pants for the night. Instead she just wraps her arms around your chest and draws a deep sigh. For a long moment both you just lie there locked to each other. You suddenly feel that the situation is tremendously awkward, like a young pair hastily married away by their parents not knowing what to do on their wedding night. You the nervous bride and she the fumbling bridegroom.
In a last ditch attempt do salvage some dignity you pretend to fall asleep. The amazon, possibly feeling the same, makes no attempt to call your bluff and relaxes slightly. Lying there in her warm embrace your mind. What was she trying to achieve by coming into your bed, all touchy feely? Why do you find these lewd out-of-wedlock acts so exciting? You where in no way unfamiliar with what men and women did in the dark, courtesy of the other cadets at the academy and you frequently participated in their dirty discussions but in your fantasies it was a future wife who was subject to your depravities. Not to mention that you always fantasized about a smaller blushing girl, fidgeting and nervous, not a bronzen colossus having you nervous and fidgeting. You don't even know her name. What IS her name? is the last thing you remember before real sleep finds you.

You wake up late the next morning, alone. As you crawl out the tent you wonder if the awkward night made the amazon steal away in shame while it was still dark. You are surprised at how your heart clenches at the thought. You don your now dry uniform jacket and ponder this small hook in your heart. Surely you can't develop feelings for a savage? Not after how she nearly battered you to death just a day ago? Maybe your feelings stem from a protective instinct from when she was unconscious in your care?
You hear a slight rustling and you turn to see a the titan woman coming trough the forest carrying something. You feel more relieved to see her than you have any right to do.
She carries what appears to be a small deer in one hand and her spear in the other. Had she woken early to hunt? She drops the spear next to the shelter and walks over to the fireplace, looking around at the various utensils left there. At first you are puzzled at what she's up to but then realize what she's doing. You met her returning from a hunting trip. Her loincloth doesn't hold any blades of any kind except the small one she used when administering the resin on your wound. She obviously did not intend to dress the animal in the forest. Now she's looking for whatever tool you used to deal with the boar she had felled.
You bring out the bayonet from the backpack and walk over to her. You hold out the bayonet hilt first. She drops the deer and accepts the bayonet cautiously. Her eyes go wide when she draws it from the scabbard.
"ɠɨœɹd͡ʒ ɸɐ ðɻ͜ɐɕ͡ʃçɵt͡ʃ!" she proclaims, eyes wide.
Again you have no idea what she said but you can tell she's impressed.
After studying the blade for a moment she squats down and goes to work on the deer. You sit down opposite her and observe her work.
She is exceptionally good with a blade. Remembering your night you redden slightly but it also brings to mind the mystery of her name.
Deciding that after what has happened between you, for the sake of decency you need to know each others names. You gather courage and look up at her.
"Excuse me"
She stops her work and looks at you. Your courage waivers somewhat but you press on.
"May I have the pleasure of your name, miss?" you say in your politest voice and immediately feel rock stupid for even trying to speak English to her.
She just stares at you.
You point to yourself.
"Emanuel" you say, making sure to pronounce every syllable. Then you point at her and intensely hoping she'll understand.
She quietly mouths your name to herself for a moment then she points to herself.
"ɚ̃͡ɲɣ͜ɑ" she says.
Anya. That's the closest facsimile in english you figure.
Then she points to you.
"Eme- Ame- Amem-" She shakes her head. She has obviously a hard time pronouncing your name.
"ɬʊ͜͡ɱ" she says pointing to you. Lum? Did she call you Lum? Did she misunderstand the exercise?
"ɚ̃͡ɲɣ͜ɑ - ɬʊ͜͡ɱ. ɚ̃͡ɲɣ͜ɑ - ɬʊ͜͡ɱ." She says pointing at herself and you in turn.
You open your mouth to correct her but she raises a finger to silence you.
"ɬʊ͜͡ɱ" she says pointing at you, giving you a look that begets no questions, you are now Lum.
Stumped by the exchange you sit silent for a moment. Well, at least you got her name. You'll have to bone out this Lum business later.
You pick up a rock and point to it.
"Rock" you say. She looks at the rock.
"ʃ͡θ͜ɚɨ" is the reply. She then points to a tree.
"ʂɮɑ͜ɱ" she says.
"Tree" you reply.
You and Anya spend the rest of the morning doing various tasks around the camp playing your word game. You quickly learn basic words in her language and is impressed to see that Anya is all but keeping pace with you. Soon you are both engrossed in correcting each others pronunciations and laughing at particularly egregious mispronunciations. You play charades and the fact that you, an officer under the crown plays charades with a scantily clad titan somehow feels both normal and justified.
All hostile feelings from the previous day are forgotten despite that both of you bear clear marks of your first diplomatic incidents.
Quicker than you imagined possible, you and Anya communicates in a very basic fashion using gestures and an amalgam between your two languages. It's mostly just nouns and some verbs injected here and there but you can share information almost passably.

Whatever community Anya belongs to is clearly familiar on some level with metals but judging from the interest with which Anya interrogate you about your bayonet and components of the mess kit, they most likely are very primitive with their metal work.
An oddity you note is that she refers to the various metal objects you possess as made of skin or bone depending on the thickness of the object. The bayonet is a bone and the metal pot is skin for instance. What animal she thinks they are made from you quite don't understand but you think it's a bird of some sort. You don't bother to correct her about the true nature of metal as you have no way of describing foundries, mining and metalworking as of yet.
Could they believe that the native metals are remnants of some long dead beast perhaps?
You file that query to the long list of mysteries you hope Anya can shed light upon when you learn to communicate on a passable level.
Afternoon comes around and you find yourself sitting by the fireplace doing the best to impress Anya with the lighter and fire making skills. While she seem impressed with the lighter, you get the feeling that she's more impressed with you having a lighter than the lighter itself.
Could she have seen a lighter before? Have the tribe she belongs to been contacted by civilization before?
That would certainly expedite your efforts to return to the civilized world. At the same time you find it hard to believe that a tribe of literal giants could have been discovered and the story not spread like wildfire.
As you ponder this the sound a tiger with toothache would make emanates from Anyas stomach. Hearing that sound makes you hungry as well, contagious like a yawn. The dried meat you put up has all fallen victim to Anyas voracious appetite during the morning, leaving you with little food except for the skinned deer hanging from a branch. You feel you cant blame her for eating it all as you had a hard time feeding her properly during her days of convalescence. Remembering that you still have a pair of D-rations left you procure them and offers one to her. She sniffs it cautiously and takes a careful bite. She chews slowly and makes a frowning face at the bitter taste of dark chocolate. Still she gulps it down and finishes the rest in short order.
You, half way through gnawing at your bar comes under her intense predatory stare as the chocolate did little to still her hunger. For a moment you almost wonder if it's you or the chocolate that will fall prey to her voracity.
Her eyes soon shift to the deer and using the bayonet she cuts some thin bamboo sticks. Stripping thin strips from the bamboo she ties two A shaped frames and plants them firmly opposite each others by the fire. She the spears the deer carcass on a longer stick and places the spit over the fire to roast.
Soon the air is filled with the fragrance of cooking meat. You and Anya sit in silence, observing the roasting deer the silence only broken by the growling in both of your bellies. After a while, Anya prods the meat with a sharpened bamboo stick and nods approvingly.
Giving you a smile full of pride she gestures you to help yourself to a meal. Far too hungry to insist on ladies first, you carve yourself a generous portion into the pan of the mess kit.
Seeing your portion Anya gives a little scoff and tears herself the entire leg roast by hand. She then proceeds to dig into the leg roast in a most unladylike fashion, holding onto the bones with both hand and tearing chunks of meat with her teeth with great appetite.
Normally you'd remark to yourself about the nature of the savage but you find yourself transfixed as you notice that the large amounts of grease and meat juices dripping from the meat forms a small river down her chin down her neck and slowly trickles down her cleavage.
Soon her breasts are shining in the fire, speckled with grease from the meat. The sensual savagery before you transfix you to the degree that you are only remember to eat your own meal when Anya reaches and tears herself the second leg.
Feeling ashamed at staring so unabashedly at her cleavage you dig into the dripping meat before you. The taste is raw and unseasoned but you are too hungry to care.
Towards the afternoon by the time you have finished eating, Anya has consumed almost half the deer herself. You, full to the point of nausea marvel at how anyone not a lion can eat that much meat in one sitting. Still not finished, Anya grabs a femur and snaps it over her knee. You remember from survival training that bone marrow is some of the most nutritious substance in an animal. Despite you feeling full like a tick you want to stay true to your training so you grab the second femur. You feel yourself go blue and every old bruise on your body ache as you in vain try to snap the bone. Anya laughs and takes the bone from you.
In what you are sure is a demonstration in power you see her muscles bulge in her arms and shoulders as she snaps the bone without even placing it over her knee. She smirks and hand back the now broken bone.
You meekly accept. Sucking at the marrow, you feel irritation build within you. You are the Man in this situation, yet this savage, big as she might be, treats you like a child. The same irritation you felt with the American captain bubbles inside your chest. You try to think of a way to one up her but you can't see how you could possibly defeat someone of that strength in any capacity. Not without having a common language at least.
Anya gets to her feet and stretch luxuriously like a big cat. You still sitting, your head almost at knee level with her see her bound breasts profile against the sky. Some of the juices from the meal made its way between her breasts down to her abs and is congealing between them. A familiar heat builds within you. The filthiness and the lewdness of it all somehow turns you on in a way you didn't know was possible. Anya looks down at her stained chest and makes a face like she first now notice the juice drippings. She slowly runs her index finger over the curve of a bound breast, leaving a slight trail in the greasy fluid. She then proceeds to lick her finger clean in an extravagant manner, her lips and tongue playing over her finger in a way that makes a beast inside you roar. She knows exactly what she's doing to you, you are sure of.
"Anya dirty" she proclaims in a soft voice.
"Anya clean in water" she continues, gesturing in the direction of the waterfall.
Oh no, she will not tempt you into sin that easy. You are still a god fearing man and a gentleman. The irritation that's been building within you makes you want to show it's you who are in control.
You gesture towards the remaining meat.
"Emanuel dry meat" you say trying to keep any lust or irritation out of your voice.
"You Lum" she corrects you and with that she turns around and heads off, hips and butt swaying.
The irritation and lust inside you burns hotter in equal measure. You really really want to get back at her somehow, preferably in a sexual manner. Still, you suppress as much of your emotions as possible by constantly reminding yourself of your station in society and your role as a representative being an official of the crown.
You busy yourself by cutting the remaining meat in thin strips and putting it to dry on a bamboo scaffolding by the fire.
Your work soon done and little else to do you wonder where Anya got to. She's been gone the entire time you prepared the meat. How long can it take to wash up after a meal? The sun is almost setting.
The image of Anya washing herself, naked, stokes fires inside you again. You try to calm yourself but it's no use. The mental image of Anya covering herself, naked and embarrassed in the face of your stern admonishment over misnaming you, staying away too long and leaving you to deal with the leftovers fuels you as you start to make your way towards the waterfall. There is a dark edge to your fantasies. The fact that she is somehow smaller and weaker than you in your mind makes you forget the events of yesterday.

As you approach the waterfall, you crouch and move as quietly as possible. You want to catch her off guard.
Creeping along under some low ferns you get in sight of the basin but you don't see Anya. Did she head home and you missed her on your way here?
Then you hear a splashing off to your right and see Anya enter the water. The sight of her as she wades away from your hiding spot towards the waterfall empties your mind of all else but her. Her naked butt in the light of the setting sun fills your world. You could drop a penny on that butt and catch it on the bounce. From your prone position under the fern you imagine you see a glimpse of a puffy vulva obscured by those large round cheeks.
You instantly become rock hard. All you ever want in this world is to bury your face in that swaying butt and stay there until the end of times. Then she reaches the waterfall and turns around in your direction as the water hits her from above.
Her wet hair drapes across her shoulders over her round breasts, almost hiding a pair of dark nipples, erect under the cold water. Water form rivulets as it flows between and over her breasts over her abs and hips, down in a tuft of silvery white hair covering her mons. She stands with her legs slightly apart, face turned up facing the water. She slowly runs her hands over her shoulders, down over her breasts over her abs. She cups one breast and lift it slightly while she in excruciating detail cleans below, between and over her breasts in turn.
One hand works down over her abdomen again, down between her legs and up again, fingers combing trough the silvery bush.
You crawl up on your knees and your hand shoots down between your legs. Your tight belt blocks the way. You break your eyes away from the brown angel in front of you and look down as you fight with the clasp of your belt.
As you fumble with the clasp a niggling thought makes itself heard through your blurred mind.
How did you get to the basin before Anya despite you spending such time with preparing the drying meat?
Your clasp comes lose, your right hand finds your raging erection and you look up.
Anya is looking directly back at you across the pool.
Trapped.
Panic fills your mind as you scramble away from your hiding spot, away from the naked demon across the pool.
You try to rise and run but your pants fall down and trap your legs tripping you.
You hear loud splashing behind you and a primal terror takes over.
Like a rabbit in a snare you trash on the ground, trapped by pants entangled in your boots.
Grabbing you from behind as you try to kick free, a strong arm reaches across you, grabs your wrist and pins your arms to your chest, hard as an iron band. You try to curl your knees up over your stomach but powerful legs wrap around yours, forcing you straight. You're trapped. The wolf has the rabbit.
You feel the dampness of her skin soak trough your jacket and the softness of her breast press harder than ever into you.
Anya rolls over on her back with on top of her and she tightens her grip forcing you you into an arc. Her chin is resting on top of your head and you feel her hard breathing reverberate through your body as her chest rise and fall under you.
You feel like a small butterfly in the tender embrace of a spider. Her hand quickly searches your lower body until it finds your hard shaft.
She grips it gently. You cease your struggling, close your eyes and accept you punishment.
Her grip around your erection tightens sharply to an almost painful degree and you draw you wince sharply. The grip softens and she slowly start to stroke up and down. The unfamiliar pleasure of her soft hand cause you to draw a sharp breath and Anya, noting your every reaction trough her grip on you speeds up in response.
Her squeezing and tugging forces large amounts of precum to leak from the tip of your dick and soon your shaft is slick with your own lubrication.
Fear, pleasure and humiliation mix in your mind. Her hand feels burning on your dick, the unexpected squeezes and changes in rhythm leaves your mind reeling, unable to guess or adapt. She places her index finger on top of the head of your penis and the sensation makes you gasp in pleasure.
Her finger rubs back and forth over your tip as the rest her hand continue to work up and down you shaft. You feel your shaft jerk as your orgasm builds. Anya quickens her stroking to a blur and suddenly without warning your mind goes blank as explode into her hand, thick viscous cum shooting in bursts again and again.
She has her hand closed around the tip of your penis until you go flaccid. She brings her sticky hand above your faces and explores the cum in her hand, rubbing it between her fingers for texture and making strings between her thumb and index finger. She moves her hand above your head and you hear her lick the cum as she tastes it.
Her grip on lightens a bit. Thinking she's done try to wriggle free. Instantly her grip tightens. She is not done with you.
As if to punish you for trying to escape, she returns her hand to your flaccid dick. You stand little chance against her this time, her hand sticky with her saliva and your cum. You are soon hard again and now armed with the knowledge of how dicks work she attacks relentlessly. Your mind fills with nothing but pleasure as her hand milks your dick.
She experiments with twists, squeezes and touches, coaxing every weakness from you.
You feel another orgasm build but suddenly she slows her pace and you feel it recede.
"You name" she asks her voice soft but deadly like a snake.
"Emanuel" You croak.
"You name? she hisses sharply.
"Emanu-" your you manage before the arm over your chest tightens to an impossible degree, choking you like a python.
"Name" she hisses.
"Lum" you hiss in pain.
Immediately the grip releases and her hand on your dick springs into action, pushing you over the edge. Your mind goes blank with pleasure.
You are left gasping for breath, face covered with your tears and saliva as your climax subsides.
Anya nuzzles your hair, still holding you in her firm grip. Her hand begins to stroke your dick again.
You start to plead for mercy but Anya not understanding hushes you to silence softly. Tears and drool run down your face, pleasure fills your mind again as you go hard.
"Name" Anya whispers softly.
You don't answer. Anya quickens her pace stroking your shaft and you feel a third climax build.
Anya keeps building you up and then relaxes, letting you recede. Again and again. Your mind goes blank and you feel your eyes roll upwards, your whole body hurts from her grip and the constant teasing, aching for release.
"P-please" you beg in a desperate voice.
"Name" Anya whispers barely audible.
"Lum! Lum!" you almost sob out.
Anya jerks your dick with an almost painful speed and you moan loudly as your third orgasm racks your body. Your mind is blank and your vision flashes. Your body feels limp like dough in her hands. She releases her grip on you and strokes your hair with her clean hand.
She wipes tears from your eyes.
"You Lum" Anya purrs softly.
How long you lay there, you on top of her, Anya stroking your hair and wiping your tears you don't know. You feel her to her feet and you spill on the ground. You feel to tired and humiliated to move.
You feel yourself getting lifted up in her strong arms and you look up to see Anya look down at you a warm smile on her face. Her green eyes glitter when she looks at you. You doze off.
When you wake up find yourself looking into a small fire your cheek rests on something soft. It's dark.
You roll over on your back and find that Anya has your head in her lap and she is patting your head again. Dressed in her usual loincloth and leather wrappings again she has pulled your pants back up and smoothed your wrinkled jacket. All feels calm and quiet.
The memories of what happened by the waterfall feels almost distant like a dream but the ache in your body and groin is a very present testament to the veracity of the event.
You move to get up but Anya gently pushes you back into her lap.
"Lum rest" she says, eyes glittering with love.
"Lum good" she repeats over and over, voice soft and warm.
You close your eyes and try to make sense of a tornado of conflicting emotions inside you.
You feel violated, assaulted and humiliated. At the same time you remember the immense pleasure, your fantasies about her and some parts of you feel that the events at the waterfall went far better than you could ever dream of. The conflict in your mind makes you tired.
"Sleep" you mumble. You hope you and Anya went over sleep during your mutual treatise of the pup tent.
You wave vaguely towards the tent to reinforce your point. Anya picks you up like you're a small child and carries you over to the tent.
You don't bother to protest.
She gently places you by the tent and you crawl inside and collapse on the greatcoat. Anya crawls inside after you and pulls you into her warm embrace. Her soft breasts against you, her smooth skin against your cheek and her strong arms around sends another wave of conflicting feelings crashing against your mind but you are too tired to care. You fall asleep quickly.
